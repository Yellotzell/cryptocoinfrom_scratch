    "The introduction of cryptocurrency was born by the need for a decentralised monetary system. That would imply the establishment of a mechanism that would allow online peer to peer transactions without the need for any central authority to either guarantee security or regulate the currency. In the case of these decentralised exchanges (DEX)<sup>[[1]](#ref)</sup>  that are based on blockchain technology the major challenge was to achieve a wide agreement on the state of the cryptocurrency network across the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrary to systems which have a central administrator with the authority to change its state (e.g. databases maintained by governments or organisations), the public blockchains distribute this authority across the network and rely on consensus mechanisms to self regulate and dynamically change its state by wider agreement. For this to be achieved, a consensus mechanism (essentially a set of rules) should be fault tolerant, fair and transparent, secure and efficient<sup>[[2]](#ref)</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, a consensus mechanism should ensure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- all the network users should be able to contribute to decision making in terms of its state in a way that meets everyone's concerns<sup>[[3]](#ref)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "- all the network users should have equal input opportunities into the shaping of its state (as much as possible)(Egalitarianism)<sup>[[4]](#ref)</sup>\n",

A solution was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin) with a list of rules known as the proof of work (PoW) protocol.\n",

    "The Bitcoin consensus could fit into three major categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agreement about the rules**\n",
    "The nodes across the network have to agree on:\n",
    "- a definition of criteria to validate transactions\n",
    "- a definition of criteria to validate blocks\n",
    "- the protocol of communication between the nodes and the data formats to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agreement about the history and the state of the blockchain**\n",
    "The nodes should agree on a valid blockchain which contains only blocks that have beed verified by the network. This means that everyone should agree on what transactions have occurred in the past and who are the owners of the current existing unspent outcomes (UTXOs<sup>[[6]](#ref)</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agremment on value**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of paramount importance (not only for the crypto but the FIAT currencies as well) for the users to agree that what is exchanged is of a redeemable value. This part of consensus has a circular nature which means that one's belief about the value of Bitcoin depends on the expectation that the other nodes of the network share the same belief. This seems to be a paradox as in essence, this consensus exists only if all the users believe in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incentives to achieve consensus**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this framework in place, to achieve a functional distributed consensus, Bitcoin had to come up with a process of node selection for updating the chain. A complete random selection of nodes wouldn't be a safe option as trust would be just an assumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shatoshi took advantage of the fact that Bitcoin is not just a blockchain but a currency, and suggested that nodes selected to update the chain should be rewarded with coins for their \"honest\" behaviour. More specifically the reward mechanisms<sup>[[7]](#ref)</sup> Bitcoin has are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block reward: the creator of a block (miner) is allowed to include a coin-creation transaction in the block and choose an address of their preference as a recipient. This transaction's amount is fixed and halves every four years (Expected to be practically exhausted in 2140).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions fee: the creator a transaction (sender) can voluntarily choose to give a fraction of the input to the miner. As the block reward decreases over time, it's expected that the senders will be the main contributors to the miners in order to preserve a quality service.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the idea of the incentivisation to be functional, there should be a mechanism in place to tackle the following \n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be a fair process for selecting nodes that add blocks on the chain\n",
    "- Since adding a block is rewarded, every node would be keen on adding blocks, increasing the risk for malicious behaviour (Sybil attacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the above will be avoided, Bitcoin operates on the proof of work mechanism to allow new identities to be created. PoW suggests that the nodes to update the chain are selected according to a resource (computational work). Therefore, adding a block to the chain has a level of difficulty as it becomes a matter of competition between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of work**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PoW protocol is based on a concept of cryptography known as zero knowledge proof<sup>[[8]](#ref)</sup>. In a zero knowledge proof scenario, a prover has to provide the verifier with evidence that they are aware of a specific value without revealing any more information. Essentially it should be trivial to verify the value by just revealing it, but challenging to prove the possession of this knowledge without disclosing any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bitcoin blockchain a node has to prove that a certain amount of computational work was spent by solving a puzzle (based on Hashcash<sup>[[9]](#ref)</sup>). Then, with minimum effort, the amount of work spent can be verified so the block to be added to the chain.\n",
    "More specifically, for a valid block to be added to the blockchain a node has to execute calculate work by obtaining a hash value that is smaller that a value agreed by the network. The node that comes up with a hash that meets the criteria can propose to the network that the block should be added to the chain. Then, depending on the consensus between the users of the network, the blockchain will be updated and the reward will be collected. The difficulty for adding a block to the chain is adjusted over time as the number of the nodes competing to create blocks increase with new joiners (Bitcoin mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks which means approximately every two weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure fairness, Bitcoin adds randomness in the node selection process. Solving the puzzle to create a new identity is a Bernoulli trial experiment<sup>[[10]](#ref)</sup>). The consensus is happening over 'long' time periods (an average of 10 minutes). However, the mining nodes cannot rest assured that in the end of that time period are closer to a valid puzzle solution that will be accepted on the chain. Instead, as time goes on, the probability of successfully mining a block is increasing exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Bitcoin by design offers a probabilistic approach that tackles the traditional problems of consensus that all of its ancestors had and approximates randomness by making a selection in proportion to computer resource which is very difficult to monopolise.\n"

    "When PoW provides a reliable consensus mechanism for selecting nodes to create identities, its element of competition comes with a few concerns (discussed later). Ethereum 2.0 is sharing similar consensus principals to Bitcoin's but is replacing PoW with a different model for approving creation of new identities (blocks). This mechanism is known as Proof of stake (PoS) and promotes a node selection in proportion to ownership of the currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum 2.0 replaces miners with validators. Validators are responsible for gathering transactions and creating blocks so the nodes can agree on the state of the network. To ensure an 'honest' behaviour a node will have to stake 32 ETH for becoming a validator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Validators can be rewarded for the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attesting<sup>[[11]](#ref)</sup>: approving blocks as valid to be added on the chain\n",
    "- Proposing blocks to be added on the chain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are allocated randomly between validators. If they fail to credibly perform them (e.g. attesting malicious blocks or going offline when attesting) they can lose all or proportion of their stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding and Beacon chain**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding<sup>[[12]](#ref)</sup> in the context of Ethereum is the splitting of the blockchain horizontally. Along with the move to PoS, Ethereum 2.0 intends to introduce 64 shard chains with common understanding of the state of the network. \n",
    "This way Ethereum 2.0 avoids increasing the size of the blockchain (like Bitcoin) that would make access for network validators difficult due to the need for expensive equipment and computational power. Having shard chains, there is only need to process the data for the shard to be validated and not the entire network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the network congestion is being reduced and the transactions speed increases as blocks will are added to multiple chains (shards). Apart from the scaling, sharding has multiple benefits. For example, sharding will encourage more network participation which means improvement to security. As the network becomes larger the failure points and the attack surface decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responsibility of coordination of such a complex network for Ethereum 2.0 lays with a mechanism known as Beacon chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beacon chain<sup>[[13]](#ref)</sup> gathers the state information from each shard and makes it available to the others allowing the network to stay synchronised. It also acts as a validator manager by registering stake deposits and issuing rewards and penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a transaction is submitted on a shard, the beacon chain is responsible to algorithmically choose a validator that will propose a block to be added on the chain. It is critical for the PoS protocol that the tasks are allocated to validators randomly. As randomness can be very challenging when it comes to blockchain systems, beacon chain safeguards that the assignment of tasks is unpredictable, unbiased and can be verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attestation** \n",
    "\n",
    "The validators that are not chosen to propose a block have to attest another's block proposal and let beacon chain know that they approve its addition to the chain.\n",
    "For successfully verifying an Ethereum 2.0 shard block a minimum of 128 validators need to attest it. This set of validators is known as \"Committee\".\n",
    "This group of nodes has a specific time window (called slot) in which it is able to propose and validate a block. In each slot only one block can be added and 32 slots consist an epoch. Then, beacon chain disbands the committee and randomly generates a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crosslinks and Finality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a block proposal concentrates a sufficient number of attestations a crosslink is generated. This means that the block is included in the beacon chain and the validator can receive the respective reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another measure of security adds the transaction's finality. We consider that a transaction has finallity when it is part of a block on the chain that cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum's proof of work uses Casper protocol<sup>[[14]](#ref)</sup>  to set checkpoints for blocks to be finalised. A block is considered finalised with the consensus of 66% of the validators. \n",
    "\n",
    "An attempt to change a finalised block will result in validators losing their stake. This is an innovation introduced by Ethereum's 2.0 in terms of PoS. Casper protocol is designed to operate in an not trustworthy system but still ensure security by penalising  Malicious behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike PoW, PoS in not relying on the usage of significant amounts of computational power as nodes are selected randomly and are not competing for the reward. Validators guarantee an honest behaviour by putting Ether on stake."

    "Bitcoin and Ethereum are sharing similar objectives when it comes to establishing distributed consensus. However each coin's mechanism for creating blocks and changing the state of the network is fundamentally different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of work was introduced in 1993 (it was coined and formalised in 1999<sup>[[15]](#ref)</sup>) and successfully provided security and trust for the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the major concerns though about the PoW protocol is its environmental impact. Consensus is achieved through a continuous, energy hungry competition between nodes. The paramount  electricity consumption consumed to mine Bitcoin blocks (a \"reasonable\" assessment from Cambridge University is suggesting the yearly consumption is between 26.45 and 177.28 at the time of writing<sup>[[16]](#ref)</sup> ) was one of the main drivers for Ethereum 2.0 to turn into alternative mechanisms like PoS. Even with the evolution of more energy efficient computer equipments, an improvenent in the electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining would be debatable. The reason is that essentially PoW is not directly using computation for protecting security but the financial cost the computation. Even in the case of the use of renewable energy the competition between nodes will just adjust their electricity consumptions into their higher potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, PoW requires significant financial potential (expensive equipment) which as a fact is not encouraging wider participation. On the other hand, Ethereum's 2.0 PoS allows a more decentralised view with users not having to invest in hardware and energy consumption. Sharding helps to increase participation as users can run Ethereum clients without the need of intermediary services. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of security, PoW is expected to improve the resistance towards 51% attacks. In the case of Bitcoin, to perform such an attack one should have ownership of more that 51% of the the network's mining hash rate. In PoS to control the network the attacker has to own 51% of all the Ether available. This is far more difficult to achieve and involves a high risk of the validator loosing a significant amount of coins. Furthermore, Ethereum's Casper protocol managed to tackle fundamental PoS issues (\"Nothing at stake\"<sup>[[17]](#ref)</sup>). The protocol requires that validators of a block commit certain amount of coins into the Casper contract. Then, Casper keeps track of validators transactions voting. These transactions would be valid for any block but if Casper detects two votes from the same validator in two different blocks of the same height, it will eliminate the Ether from this group of validators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, PoS is a relatively new method to be used from Ethereum 2.0 which means that it is not yet tested over time as much as POW is. However, a successful and faultless implementation of Casper and PoS will play an important role in Ethereum's plan to grow and scale up."
