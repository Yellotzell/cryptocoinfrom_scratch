    "The Bitcoin's existence is different than a traditional currency's. Its value is not stored on a hard drive, spreadsheet or account. Bitcoin essentially exist on the blockchain which is a record of transactions between addresses that correspond to users. This record is only updated by the Bitcoin network, and then it is shared across the nodes of the network containing every time the latest information on the addresses' balance. In general, a transaction includes three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An input. A person states the address that the money to be spent came from.\n",
    "- The amount.\n",
    "- An output. That includes the address of the person that the money is transferred to (making it available for spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performing such a bitcoin transaction is a synonym to having access to a pair of keys. The amount of bitcoins then associated to those keys is essentially the balance of the person who owns them. The method that underpins this concept and ensures that transactions are secure and anonymous is the Asymmetric Encryption Cryptography<sup>[[7]](#ref)</sup>.  \n",
    "As we mentioned before the blockchain is available to the network, which means that addresses (deriving from public key) are a kind of transparent vaults. Everyone can see what amount the vault has in, but only the private key holder has access to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the case of Ethereum to update its block chain a transaction must be broadcasted to the network. This is a message signed with cryptographic methods and defines what are the changes to be made. That then is send to a node and if the consensus rules are met<sup>[[8]](#ref)</sup> the network agrees to integrate the block to the block chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount to be transferred\n",
    "- Binary Data (In the case of contract deployment the bytecode is send here)\n",
    "- The maximum amount of gas to be consumed for this transaction\n",

    "- A sequence number (defining the sender's previous transaction). This has to match the next transaction and is called nonce.\n",
    "- Data that identify and authenticate the sender (signature)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One fundamental difference between the two cryptocurrencies is that Bitcoin's transactions are based on a Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) model and Ethereum is operating on an Account model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most revolutionary features in the world of cryptocurrencies is the introduction of smart contracts. Ethereum's contracts is essentially a program that runs on the blockchain. The functions and the state (data) of this program can exist at a specific address. As regular contracts, smart contracts can define that are automatically executable by the code. Every public function of Solidity<sup>[[9]](#ref)</sup> (an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts) that can change state can be called via a transaction. To call a function it's required to have the address of the contract, the name of the function and the function's arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Both Bitcoin and Ethereum perform a form of state transitions of a blockchain. In Bitcoin, the blockchain guarantees through a cryptographically secure way to update state of the blockchain to transfer coins between users. The state of the blockchain can be verified by anyone and all the state transitions are initiated as transactions by users. In the case of coins, a few moments before a transaction updates the blockchain a senders account has for example 10 coins and after the blockchain update a receiver's account has the 10 coins when the sender has 0. Ethereum though exploits the fact that there is not an inherit limitation to this system that prevents the state transition of a blockchain to be implemented for just coin exchange. It generalises the state transitions of the blockchain into software included in the transactions. Therefore, since with Ethereum a blockchain can perform any kind of computation defined in the transaction it enables more functionality. Given that these computations are in a Turing-complete language many applications are possible. A few examples would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A requirement for certain number of users to agree if the money in a transaction can be spent.\n",
    "- Money in a transaction could be returned to the sender according to the conditions of an agreement.\n",
    "- There could be a requirement for external data to be produced for the money in a transaction to be spent.\n",

    "Based on the fact that Bitcoin and Ethereum are operating on a different transaction models we can attempt a comparison in terms of flexibility and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin the transactions are processed by Bitcoin Virtual Machines (BVMs). Essentially, every node of the network has a virtual machine that executes a sequence of computations in a stack. Therefore, there is no persistent storage in such a virtual machine to support global state. The Bitcoin's global state is represented by multiple independent UTXOs. This means that Bitcoin can be considered as a cohort of machines, horizontally scalable that can indefinitely expand by adding machines on the network. In terms of smart contracts functions (that reside in UTXOs) its execution is stateless. This means that, similarly to close mathematical functions, given the same input one can always expect the same output. As a result, Bitcoin makes transactions with smart contracts less prone to complexity and errors. Additionally, as these functions are not affecting or being affected by other calls on the network they can be tested offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand side, Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM) is fundamentally different than Bitcoin's. It exists as a single entity maintained by all the connected computers running an Ethereum client. In this state machine reside all the accounts and smart contracts and the Ethereum protocol is responsible for maintaining an uninterrupted and immutable operation. EVM's data are stored either in the stack, memory or storage. Memory and storage are reset when the virtual machine is running a new transaction. The storage remains as a part of the global state. For this reason there can be dependency between transactions since the could read and write on the same storage. Essentially an Ethereum transaction perceives the global state as it was left by a previous transaction or contract execution. As concurrency is not supported, transactions are executed on a sequential way. This vertical scaling, in contrary to the Bitcoin, could theoretically be less efficient as the number of users grow. Specifically in terms of contracts, it gives flexibility to the users to develop more complex functions at their will. This complexity might be useful but comes with the risk of errors and vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Bitcoin featuring Turing-incomplete contracts in its transactions offer less flexibility to the users. On the other hand it makes it less vulnerable to attack. Along with its increasing security backed from hashing power (BTC vs ETH)<sup>[[10]](#ref)</sup> makes the double-spending difficult for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One has to gain access to a wallet with a sufficient amount of coins for the attack to be worthwhile. Buying though enough coins to make such an attack viable would increase its price to an extent that the attack would not be worth it anymore.\n",
    "- To perform an attack one should have control of 51% or more of the network to make valid double spendings which is a nearly impossible scenario and its cost would make the attach not worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum on the other hand could be considered as a programmable value. Its flexibility would allow for example to create tokens that represent shares, access and permissions or distributed control on assets with people one may not trust. Examples of successful Ethereum applications are the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). However, this flexible design creates more vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. Few of the many known attacks are Displacement, Insertion and Suppression <sup>[[11]](#ref)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we could say that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have advantages and disadvantages. Bitcoin would compromise its flexibility to achieve better security when Ethereum offers flexibility but that comes with some security issues. Although both can be used as mediums of exchange and store value there are some conceptual distinctions that make both valuable in its own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Bitcoin was created as an alternative to national currencies and thus aspires to be a medium of exchange and a store of value, Ethereum was intended as a platform to facilitate immutable, programmatic contracts, and applications via its own currency. \n",

    "Bitcoin addresses are the only way to identify transactions<sup>[[12]](#ref)</sup>. However, users can access the transaction history of any address, therefore it is suggested to use each address only once. For privacy protection purposes and in order to isolate transactions, one should use a new address each time a payment is received. Users should also avoid publishing Bitcoin addresses online in order to be protected from other users identifying their addresses. It is also advised that users hide their IP addresses to avoid them being logged. Further research is underway in order to improve Bitcoin's privacy features.\n",

    "Ethereum operates differently to Bitcoin in the sense that it keeps a record of a user's spending and balance; as an analogue one could say the user is like having a bank account. This protocol is different than Bitcoin's protocol that we mentioned above, where the user would use a new address for each payment. A recent paper from researchers at the Institute for Computer Science and Control in Hungary<sup>[[13]](#ref)</sup>, argues governments and private-entities are quickly learning how to strip away anonymity from Ethereum. The authors specifically say *“Careless usage easily reveals links between deposits and withdraws and also impact the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set”.*\n",
